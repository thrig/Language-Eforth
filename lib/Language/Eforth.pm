=head1 NAME

Language::Eforth - a tiny embedded Forth interpreter

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Language::Eforth;
  our $f = Language::Eforth->new;

  $f->eval("2 2 + .s\n");
  print scalar $f->pop, "\n";

  $f->push(3, 7);
  print "depth: ", $f->depth, "\n";

  $f->eval("+\n");
  print scalar $f->pop, "\n";

  $f->reset;

  # there are, however, better ways to reverse a list of small
  # integers than this
  $f->eval("1 2 3 4\n");
  my @reverse = $f->drain;  # qw(4 3 2 1)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module embeds a tiny embeddable Forth interpreter.

L<https://github.com/howerj/embed>

The interpreter has a 16-bit cell size, does not support floating point
values, AND CONTRARY TO THE ans fORTH SPECIFICATION REQUIRES LOWER-CASE
WORDS. Consult C<embed.fth> for details on various "Error Codes" and
other documentation.

Memory usage while not zero should not be very significant; it mostly
depends on the C<EMBED_CORE_SIZE> count of 16-bit cells allocated. And
whatever Perl needs. Assertion failures are also possible, unless the
compile was somehow done with C<-DNDEBUG>.

=head1 METHODS

These may C<croak> should something be awry with the input, or if memory
allocation fails in the constructor.

=over 4

=item B<depth>

Returns the data stack depth as an unsigned integer.

=item B<drain>

Utility method to drain the data stack of all values as unsigned
integers, or returns the empty list otherwise. See also B<reset>.

Since version 0.02.

=item B<eval> I<expr>

Evaluates the string I<expr>. I<expr> MUST end with a newline. Output
from words such as C<.s> or C<.> or C<u.> is sent to standard output;
use L<Capture::Tiny> or similar to redirect this, if need be.

Input could be specified in a heredoc (see C<eg/shape> for an example)
or could be loaded into a string via a module like L<File::Slurper>.

No return value.

=item B<new>

Constructor. Returns a pointer to the interpreter used by the
other methods.

=item B<pop>

Pops an unsigned integer off of the data stack. In list context this
returns the value and the return code. If the code is non-zero something
went awry, probably a stack under- or overflow.

  my ( $value, $failed ) = $f->pop;
  if ( $failed ) { die "pop failed ($failed)\n" }

Otherwise, use the return value in scalar context, but then there is a
semipredicate problem where C<0> could mean the value zero, or that
there was a failure:

  my $v;
  $f->reset;              # empty the stack
  $f->eval("2 2 xor\n");  # calculate a value
  $v = scalar $f->pop;    # 0, the value
  $v = scalar $f->pop;    # 0, the semipredicate (underflow)

The value can be made 16-bit signed via:

  $f->push(54321);
  my $x = $f->pop;
  my $y = Language::Eforth::signed($x);
  say "$y $x";            # -11215 54321

See also B<drain>.

=item B<push> I<integer> [ I<integer> .. ]

Pushes I<integer>s onto the data stack. Values will be modulated to the
16-bit cell size:

  $f->push(-1); 
  $f->eval("u.\n");       # 65535

Returns the number of items pushed and the return code of the last item
pushed. The count may be fewer than the number of items supplied; if so,
the return code is likely some non-zero value.

  my ( $count, $status ) = $f->push(@long_list);
  if ( $count != @long_list ) { die "get a bigger box\n"; }

Note that B<embed_push> uses a C<cell_t> or C<uint16_t> so the integer
goes through both Perl's C<SvUV> and then C's C<uint16_t>. How the forth
treats the bit patterns in the stack depends on the word involved, e.g.
C<.> verses C<u.>.

  $f->push(-1); 
  $f->eval(" dup .  dup u. \n");

Since version 0.02 B<push> accepts multiple values.

=item B<reset>

Resets the state of the interpreter. Among other things this will clear
the data stack. See also B<drain>.

No return value.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

These utility functions are not exported.

=over 4

=item B<signed> I<value>

The B<pop> and B<drain> methods tend to return unsigned short values
(C<uint16_t>); such values may need conversion on the Perl side to be
signed (C<int16_t>) for display or debugging needs. This function runs
the given value through an signed short conversion and returns the
result, after the fashion of Procrustes with his guests.

Since version 0.02.

=item B<unsigned> I<value>

Ensures that I<value> falls within the C<uint16_t> range. This will
probably happen automatically for values passed to B<push> as
B<embed_push> expects a C<uint16_t> argument.

Since version 0.02.

=back

=head1 FORTH TIPS

Read C<embed.fth>. The C<words> word can be used to print the available
words. Some of these words may be of little use as they will operate in
strange ways due to their being run under B<embed_eval> and not the full
B<embed_vm>.

  $f->eval("words\n");

Changing C<base> can cause confusion, or worse. It may help to pull
the values out to Perl for inspection, or to not change the base if
you can avoid it.

  $f->push( 0xA, 0xB );
  $f->eval(<<'EOF');
  hex .s          \ stack: A B
  2 base !        \ change base to binary
  10 11 .s        \ stack: 1010 1011 10 11
  1010 base !     \ change base to decimal
  .s              \ stack: 10 11 2 3
  $10             \ hex, regardless of base
  EOF
  print "@{[$f->drain]}\n";    # 16 3 2 11 10

C<key> is an example of a problematic word; it reads a character
usually from a terminal or other input device, similar to L<getc(3)>.
Under this module C<key> instead reads from the string passed to the
B<eval> method:

  $f->eval(<<'EOF');
  key
  *
  .s              \ stack: 42
  EOF

C<key> and similar words might best be left unused in this module.
External forth code that relies on them will need to be ported to run
under this module.

        Second version. The world is perhaps less unsuspecting
        now. Oh, the changes? Right. Let's see.
          * add eg/shape example script
          * add the ->drain, signed(), unsigned() utility calls
          * better ensure that drain, pop, and push use unsigned
            values due to embed_pop and embed_push using
            uint16_t cells and function parameters
          * skip build if embed sources are not present
          * make the XS somewhat less bad?
          * more documentation, tests
          * push now accepts multiple values, with consequently
            higher odds of some sort of stack error
